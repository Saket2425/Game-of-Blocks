## META COIN

### View Functions
  By this we can only view the state varibles. We cannot change any state varible. So functions like ViewDues uses view because we have to only view the loans mapping in the function
### Pure Functions
  It is very much like view function but it do not read the state varibles. So in functions which require only use of passed arguments and local varible we use PURE. Since add, getCompoundInterest does not require any state varible so we use pure in such functions
